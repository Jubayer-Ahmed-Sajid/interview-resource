# Interview Questions

## React Questions

### Q1: What is React?

React is a front-end JavaScript library used for building user interface components. It is an open-source library focused on creating efficient and reusable UI components for single-page applications.

### Q2: What is JSX?

JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a syntax extension that allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. JSX is used in React to describe what the UI should look like.

### Q3: What are the major features of React?

- JSX syntax for defining components.
- Virtual DOM for efficient DOM manipulation.
- Support for server-side rendering.
- Unidirectional data flow.
- Reusable and composable UI components.

### Q4: What is the difference between Element and Component?

An element is a plain object describing what you want to appear on the screen, while a component is a function or class responsible for producing an element. Components can be composed of other components.

### Q5: How to create components in React?

Components in React can be created using either class-based components or function-based components.

### Q6: What is a class-based component in React?

A class-based component is defined using ES6 class syntax and extends the React.Component class. It was popular before the introduction of functional components.

### Q7: What is a functional component in React?

A functional component is a simple function that takes props as input and returns a React element. With the introduction of hooks, functional components gained popularity.

### Q8: What is state in React?

State in React is an object that holds information that may change over the component's lifetime. When the state changes, the component re-renders.

### Q9: What are props in React?

Props (short for properties) in React are input values passed to components. They are used to pass data from parent components to child components.

### Q10: What is the difference between props and state?

Props are used for passing data from parent to child components, while state is used to manage internal component data that may change over time.

### Q11: What is the Virtual DOM?

The Virtual DOM is a concept in React where an ideal representation of the UI is kept in memory and synced with the real DOM by a library like ReactDOM. This process is called reconciliation.

### Q12: What is the difference between Shadow DOM and Virtual DOM?

The Shadow DOM is a browser technology for scoping variables and CSS in web components. The Virtual DOM, on the other hand, is a concept implemented by libraries in JavaScript for optimizing DOM manipulations.

### Q13: What are Higher-Order Components (HOC)?

A Higher-Order Component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. It is a pattern derived from React's compositional nature.

### Q14: What is context?

Context in React provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props manually at every level. It is useful for global data such as user authentication.

### Q15: Can web browsers read JSX directly?

No, web browsers cannot read JSX directly. JSX needs to be transformed into regular JavaScript using tools like Babel.

### Q16: What is an event in React?

In React, an event is an action that a user or system triggers, such as a mouse click or key press. React events use camelCase syntax.

### Q17: What is the use of `render()` in React?

The `render()` method in React is required for each component. It returns the HTML or JSX that should be displayed in the component.

### Q18: What are the limitations of React?

Some limitations of React include being only a library (not a full-blown framework), a learning curve for beginners, and potential complexity in code due to JSX.

### Q19: What is `useState()` in React?

`useState()` is a React Hook used to introduce state in functional components. It returns an array with the current state value and a function to update the state.

### Q20: What is `useEffect()` in React?

`useEffect()` is a React Hook used for side effects in functional components. It allows performing tasks like data fetching or subscriptions after the component renders.

## Node.js Questions

### Q1: What is Node.js, and where is it used?

Node.js is a cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment used for server-side development. It is utilized for building scalable and high-performance web applications, particularly those requiring real-time features.

### Q2: What is NPM?

NPM (Node Package Manager) is a package manager for Node.js. It provides an online repository for Node.js packages and modules, allowing developers to install and manage dependencies in their projects.

### Q3: What do you understand by the term I/O?

I/O stands for Input/Output, which refers to the interaction between a program and the outside world. In Node.js, non-blocking I/O operations are a key feature for handling concurrent requests efficiently.

### Q4: How many types of API functions are available in Node.js?

Node.js provides two types of API functions: Asynchronous (non-blocking) functions and Synchronous (blocking) functions.

### Q5: Why is Node.js Single-threaded?

Node.js is single-threaded to provide asynchronous, non-blocking I/O operations. It uses an event-driven model, allowing it to handle multiple concurrent requests efficiently.

### Q6: What do you understand by the term fork in Node.js?

In Node.js, the term "fork" is used to spawn child processes. It creates a new instance of the V8 engine, enabling the execution of multiple workers for concurrent processing.

## Express.js Questions

### Q1: What is Express.js?

Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies the creation of web applications and APIs by providing a set of tools and utilities to handle routing, middleware, and HTTP requests.

### Q2: Why use Express.js?

Express.js is used for its simplicity, minimalism, flexibility, and scalability. It helps in organizing and building the server-side of web applications faster and more efficiently.

### Q3: Differentiate between Node.js and Express.js?

Node.js is the runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server side, while Express.js is a framework built on top of Node.js. Express.js provides additional tools for building web applications.

### Q4: Is Express.js a front-end or back-end framework?

Express.js is a back-end framework. It is designed for developing complete web applications and APIs, serving as the backend component of the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack.

### Q5: What are some popular alternatives to Express.js?

Popular alternatives to Express.js include Koa.js, Hapi.js, Sails.js, and Fastify.

### Q6: What is the `.env` file used for?

The `.env` file is used for storing sensitive information, such as passwords and database connection strings, in a web application. It allows developers to manage configuration variables.

## MongoDB Questions

### Q1: What is MongoDB?

MongoDB is a cross-platform document-based database categorized as a NoSQL database. It stores data in JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas, making it suitable for certain types of applications.

### Q2: What are the features of MongoDB?

- Document-based data model.
- High performance and scalability.
- Support for dynamic schemas.
- Agile and scalable database.

### Q3: What type of NoSQL database is MongoDB?

MongoDB is a document-based NoSQL database. It stores data in the form of BSON (Binary JSON) documents within collections.

### Q4: Differentiate between MongoDB and MySQL?

MongoDB is a NoSQL database with a document-based data model, while MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) with a table-based data model.

### Q5: Why is MongoDB the best NoSQL database?

MongoDB is considered a top NoSQL database due to its high performance, availability, scalability, rich query language, and document-oriented data model.

### Q6: How does indexing work in MongoDB, and why is it important?

Indexes in MongoDB help execute queries efficiently by limiting the number of documents that need to be examined. Proper indexing is crucial for improving performance in MongoDB.

### Q7: What is the significance of the ObjectId in MongoDB?

The ObjectId is a unique identifier assigned to every document in a MongoDB collection. It serves as the primary key for documents.

### Q8: How do you perform CRUD operations in MongoDB?

CRUD operations in MongoDB involve creating, reading, updating, and deleting documents from collections. These operations are performed using methods like `insert`, `find`, `update`, and `remove`.

## Conclusion

These questions cover a range of topics related to React, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. Depending on the specific role and the level of expertise required, interviewers may ask more in-depth or specialized questions.
